    "stepTitle": "Dr. John Paul Stapp was U.S. Air Force officer who studied the effects of extreme deceleration on the human body. On December $$10$$, $$1954$$, Stapp rode a rocket sled, accelerating from rest to a top speed of $$282$$ $$\\frac{m}{s}$$ (1015 km/h) in $$5.00$$ s, and was brought jarringly back to rest in only $$1.40$$ s! Calculate his acceleration in multiples of g $$(9.80$$ m/s**2) by taking its ratio to the acceleration of gravity to $$2$$ decimal places.",
