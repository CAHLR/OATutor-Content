        "text": "To express the given function \\( h(x) $$=$$ \\frac{4}{(x+2)**2} \\) as a composition of two functions \\( h(x) $$=$$ f(g(x)) \\), we need to identify two functions \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) such that applying \\( g(x) \\) first and then \\( f(x) \\) gives us the original function \\( h(x) \\).\\n\\nThe given function \\( h(x) \\) involves taking \\( $$x+2$$ \\), squaring it, and then dividing $$4$$ by the result. The key is to break down this process into two steps, each corresponding to one of the functions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\).\\n\\nLet's analyze the answer choices:\\n\\n$$1$$. \\( g(x) $$=$$ $${\\left(x+2\\right)}^2$$, f(x) $$=$$ \\frac{4}{x} \\): Here, \\( g(x) \\) first computes \\( $${\\left(x+2\\right)}^2$$ \\), and then \\( f(x) \\) takes the result of \\( g(x) \\) and divides $$4$$ by it. This composition correctly represents \\( h(x) $$=$$ \\frac{4}{(x+2)**2} \\).\\n\\n$$2$$. \\( g(x) $$=$$ $$x+2$$, f(x) $$=$$ $$x^2$$ \\): This choice doesn't work because \\( f(g(x)) \\) in this case would first add $$2$$ to \\( $$x$$ \\), and then square the result, which doesn't involve dividing $$4$$ by the square of \\( $$x+2$$ \\).\\n\\n$$3$$. \\( g(x) $$=$$ $$\\frac{4}{x}$$, f(x) $$=$$ $$x+2$$ \\): This option does not accurately represent the given function, as it involves taking the reciprocal of \\( $$x$$ \\) and then adding $$2$$, which does not match the structure of \\( h(x) \\).\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\\n\\n- \\( g(x) $$=$$ $${\\left(x+2\\right)}^2$$ \\)\\n- \\( f(x) $$=$$ \\frac{4}{x} \\)\\n\\nThis choice correctly composes the given function \\( h(x) $$=$$ \\frac{4}{(x+2)**2} \\) by first squaring \\( $$x+2$$ \\) through \\( g(x) \\) and then applying \\( f(x) \\) to divide $$4$$ by the result of \\( g(x) \\).",
