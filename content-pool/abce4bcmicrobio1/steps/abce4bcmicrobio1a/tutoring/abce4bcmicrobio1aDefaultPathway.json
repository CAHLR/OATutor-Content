        "text": "While Hippocrates is considered the father of Western medicine, the Greek philosopher and historian Thucydides $$(460-395$$ BC) is considered the father of scientific history because he advocated for evidence-based analysis of cause-and-effect reasoning. Among his most important contributions are his observations regarding the Athenian plague that killed one-third of the population of Athens between $$430$$ and $$410$$ BC. Having survived the epidemic himself, Thucydides made the important observation that survivors did not get re-infected with the disease, even when taking care of actively sick people. This observation shows an early understanding of the concept of immunity.",
