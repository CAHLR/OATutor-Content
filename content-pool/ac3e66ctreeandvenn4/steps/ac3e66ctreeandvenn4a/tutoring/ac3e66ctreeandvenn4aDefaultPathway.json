        "text": "When looking at a tree diagram, it consists of \"branches\", sometimes labeled with frequencies (whole numbers) or probabilities (fractions). Each branch of the tree represents a \"choice\" of sorts and each level represents the completion of a choice, and at the bottom of the tree--the leaf--houses the final outcomes. To get to the final outcome, you want to multiply all the probabilities going down the tree from the top to the end of the leaf.",
