        "text": "The statement is most similar to a law. A law is a statement that describes a natural phenomenon or pattern in the world. In this case, the statement describes the relationship between pressure and temperature in a sample of gas, which has been observed and measured numerous times and is considered a universal truth. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is an educated guess or prediction about a phenomenon that needs to be tested through experimentation. A theory, while similar to a law, is a more comprehensive explanation of a natural phenomenon that is supported by a large body of evidence and can be used to make predictions about future observations or experiments.",
