        "text": "Hippocrates is considered the 'father of Western medicine'. He was a Greek physician who lived from $$460$$ BCE to $$370$$ BCE. He is famous for his contributions to the field of medicine, including the Hippocratic Oath, which is still recited by medical students upon graduation today. He believed that diseases had natural causes and that illness was not a punishment from the gods. Hippocrates emphasized the importance of observing and recording symptoms and proposed treatments based on the body's natural healing processes rather than supernatural or mystical methods. His medical texts formed the basis of modern medical education and his influence can still be seen in medical practice today.",
