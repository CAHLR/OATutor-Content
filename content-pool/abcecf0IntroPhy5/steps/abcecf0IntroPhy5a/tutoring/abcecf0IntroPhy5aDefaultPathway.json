        "text": "To convert meters to feet, we multiply by $$3.281$$. So:\\nLength in feet $$=$$ $$115$$ $$m$$ $$x$$ $$3.281$$ $$\\frac{ft}{m}$$ $$=$$ $$377.215$$ ft (rounded to $$3$$ decimal places)\\nWidth in feet $$=$$ $$85$$ $$m$$ $$x$$ $$3.281$$ $$\\frac{ft}{m}$$ $$=$$ $$278.855$$ ft (rounded to $$3$$ decimal places)\\nHowever, the answer choices are given in whole numbers. To round to the nearest whole number, we look at the decimal part:\\nFor length: $$0.215$$ is closer to $$0$$ than to $$1$$, so we round down to $$377$$ ft.\\nFor width: $$0.855$$ is closer to $$1$$ than to $$0$$, so we round up to $$279$$ ft.\\nTherefore, the answer is: Length: $$377$$ ft, Width: $$279$$ ft.",
