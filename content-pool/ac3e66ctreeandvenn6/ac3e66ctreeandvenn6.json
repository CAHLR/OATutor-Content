    "body": "In an urn, there are $$11$$ balls. Three balls are red (R) an eight balls are blue (B). Draw two balls, one at a time, with replacement. \"With replacement\" means that you put the first ball back in the urn before you select the second ball. The tree diagram using frequencies that show all the possible outcomes follows. The first set of branches represents the first draw. The second set of branches represents the second draw. Each of the outcomes is distinct. In fact, we can list each red ball as R1, R2, and R3 and each blue ball as B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, and B8. Then the nine RR outcoes can be written as: R1R1; R1R2; R1R3; R2R1; R2R2; R2R3; R3R1; R3R2; R3R3. The other outcomes are similar. There are $$11(11)=121$$ outcomes, the size of the sample space.\\n##figure1.gif",
