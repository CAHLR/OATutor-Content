        "text": "The Greek physician Hippocrates $$(460-370$$ BC) is considered the \"father of Western medicine.\" Unlike many of his ancestors and contemporaries, he dismissed the idea that disease was caused by supernatural forces. Instead, he posited that diseases had natural causes from within patients or their environments. While Hippocrates is considered the father of Western medicine, the Greek philosopher and historian Thucydides $$(460-395$$ BC) is considered the father of scientific history because he advocated for evidence-based analysis of cause-and-effect reasoning. Marcus Terentius Varro $$(116-27$$ BC) was a prolific Roman writer who was one of the first people to propose the concept that things we cannot see (what we now call microorganisms) can cause disease. While it is unclear who exactly invented the microscope, a Dutch cloth merchant named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek $$(1632-1723)$$ was the first to develop a lens powerful enough to view microbes.",
