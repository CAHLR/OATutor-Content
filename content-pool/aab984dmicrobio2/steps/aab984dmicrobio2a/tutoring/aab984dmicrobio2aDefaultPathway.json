        "text": "Researchers believe that \u00d6tzi the Iceman may have been infected with Lyme disease. This is based on the presence of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, in his body. Further analysis has suggested that \u00d6tzi carried multiple strains of the bacterium, indicating that he may have suffered from repeated $$infections$$. Symptoms of Lyme disease can include fever, joint pain, and fatigue, which are consistent with some of the injuries and ailments that were found on \u00d6tzi's corpse. It is possible that the disease may have contributed to his death, although this is not certain.",
