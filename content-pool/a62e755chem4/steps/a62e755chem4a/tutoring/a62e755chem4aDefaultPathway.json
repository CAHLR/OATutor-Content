        "text": "The statement is most similar to a theory.\\n\\nA hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation or phenomenon, which still needs to be tested through further investigation.\\n\\nA law is a statement that describes a phenomenon without attempting to explain it. It is typically written in mathematical or formulaic terms, and has been proven through repeated experiments and observations.\\n\\nA theory, on the other hand, is a well-established explanation for a broad range of phenomena that has been supported by a large body of evidence over time. It is often used to make predictions and guide further research.\\n\\nIn this case, the statement \"All life on earth has evolved from a common, primitive organism through the process of natural selection\" is a well-established explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. It has been supported by a vast amount of evidence from multiple fields of study, including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy. Therefore, it is most similar to a theory.",
