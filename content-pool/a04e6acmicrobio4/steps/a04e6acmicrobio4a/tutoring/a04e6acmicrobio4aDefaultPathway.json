        "text": "People across the world have enjoyed fermented foods and beverages like beer, wine, bread, yogurt, cheese, and pickled vegetables for all of recorded history. Discoveries from several archeological sites suggest that even prehistoric people took advantage of fermentation to preserve and enhance the taste of food. Archaeologists studying pottery jars from a Neolithic village in China found that people were making a fermented beverage from rice, honey, and fruit as early as $$7000$$ BC. Production of these foods and beverages requires microbial fermentation, a process that uses bacteria, mold, or yeast to convert sugars (carbohydrates) to alcohol, gases, and organic acids. While it is likely that people first learned about fermentation by accident \u2014 perhaps by drinking old milk that had curdled or old grape juice that had fermented \u2014 they later learned to harness the power of fermentation to make products like bread, cheese, and wine.\\n\\nFermented foods also act as a fulfilling nutritional source that aid digestive health. This would allow our ancestors to reduce the amount they ate while still feeling full.\\n\\nFermented foods also provided a food source that does not spoil as easily, allowing greater flexibility while traveling.",
