        "text": "A few hundred years ago, before the invention of the microscope, the existence of many types of microbes was impossible to prove. By definition, microorganisms, or microbes, are very small organisms; many types of microbes are too small to see without a microscope, although some parasites and fungi are visible to the naked eye. While the ancients may have suspected the existence of invisible \u201cminute creatures,\u201d it wasn\u2019t until the invention of the microscope that their existence was definitively confirmed. While it is unclear who exactly invented the microscope, a Dutch cloth merchant named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek $$(1632-1723)$$ was the first to develop a lens powerful enough to view microbes. In $$1675$$, using a simple but powerful microscope, Leeuwenhoek was able to observe single-celled organisms, which he described as \u201canimalcules\u201d or \u201cwee little beasties,\u201d swimming in a drop of rain water. From his drawings of these little organisms, we now know he was looking at bacteria and protists.",
