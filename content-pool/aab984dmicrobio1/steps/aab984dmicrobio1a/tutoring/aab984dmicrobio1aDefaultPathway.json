        "text": "The process by which microbes turn grape juice into wine is called fermentation. Fermentation is a metabolic process where microorganisms, such as yeast, convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In winemaking, grape juice is filled with natural sugars from grapes, which yeast consumes to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process continues until the yeast has consumed all available sugars or is stopped by the winemaker. Over time, the wine develops its unique flavor profiles, and the alcohol concentration increases. Fermentation is a critical step in winemaking, which transforms grape juice into wine.",
