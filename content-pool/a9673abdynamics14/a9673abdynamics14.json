    "body": "A freight train consists of two $$8{10}^4$$ kg engines and $$45$$ cars with average masses of $$5.5{10}^4$$ kg. What force must each engine exert backward on the track to accelerate the train at a rate of $$5{10}^{\\left(-2\\right)}$$ $$\\frac{m}{s^2}$$ if the force of friction is $$7.5{10}^5$$ N, assuming the engines exert identical forces?",
