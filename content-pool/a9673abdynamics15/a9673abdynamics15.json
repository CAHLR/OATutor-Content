    "body": "A freight train consists of two $$8{10}^4$$ kg engines and $$45$$ cars with average masses of $$5.5{10}^4$$ kg. What is the force in the coupling between the 37th and 38th cars (this is the force each exerts on the other), assuming all cars have the same mass and that friction is evenly distributed among all the cars and engines?",
