Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for example, many biological cells, but most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the most advanced microscopes. The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains.",
