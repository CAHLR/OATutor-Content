    "stepTitle": "A rescue helicopter is hovering over a person whose boat has sunk. One of the rescuers throws a life preserver straight down to the victim with an initial velocity of $$1.40$$ $$\\frac{m}{s}$$ and observes that it takes $$1.8$$ s to reach the water. List the knowns in this problem.",
    "stepBody": "Note that the downdraft of the helicopter reduces the effects of air resistance on the falling life preserver, so that an acceleration equal to that of gravity is reasonable.",
