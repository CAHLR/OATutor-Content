# OATutor

OATutor is an Open-source Adaptive Tutoring System using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
implemented in ReactJS and optionally using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for logging. 
The whole tutoring system can be deployed on Github Pages without the use of servers. If desired, 
a server can be used to operate an included ExpressJS middleware for interoperability with LTI-compatible learning management systems 
such as [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/).
