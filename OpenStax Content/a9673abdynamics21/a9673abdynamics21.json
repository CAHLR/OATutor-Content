    "body": "An elevator filled with passengers has a mass of 1700kg. (a) The elevator accelerates upward from rest at a rate of $$\\frac{1.2m}{s2}$$ for $$1.50s$$. Calculate the tension in the cable supporting the elevator. (b) The elevator continues upward at constant velocity for $$8.50s$$. What is the tension in the cable during this time? (c) The elevator decelerates at a rate of $$\\frac{0.6m}{s2}$$ for $$3.00s$$. What is the tension in the cable during deceleration? (d) How high has the elevator moved above its original starting point, and what is its final velocity?",
