    "body": "A $$2.50-kg$$ fireworks shell is fired straight up from a mortar and reaches a height of $$110$$ $$m$$. (a) Neglecting air resistance (a poor assumption, but we will make it for this example), calculate the shell\u2019s velocity when it leaves the mortar. (b) The mortar itself is a tube $$0.450$$ $$m$$ long. Calculate the average acceleration of the shell in the tube as it goes from zero to the velocity found in (a). (c) What is the average force on the shell in the mortar? Express your answer in newtons and as a ratio to the weight of the shell.",
