Typical air density in Boulder is $$1.14$$ $$\\frac{kg}{m^3}$$, and the corresponding atmospheric pressure is 8.89\u00d710**4 $$\\frac{N}{m^2}$$. (Bernoulli\u2019s principle as stated in the text assumes laminar flow. Using the principle here produces only an approximate result, because there is significant turbulence.)",
