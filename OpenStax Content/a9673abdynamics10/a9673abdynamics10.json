    "body": "(b) Calculate the tension in a horizontal strand of spider web if the same spider sits motionless in the middle of it much like the tightrope walker in the figure. The strand sags at an angle of $$12$$ degrees below the horizontal. Compare this with the tension in the vertical strand (find their ratio).",
