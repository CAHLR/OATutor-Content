    "body": "Two children pull a third child on a snow saucer sled exerting forces $$F_1$$ and $$F_2$$ as shown from above in the figure. Find the acceleration of the $$49.00kg$$ sled and child system. Note that the direction of the frictional force is unspecified; it will be in the opposite direction of the sum of $$F_1$$ and $$F_2$$.",
