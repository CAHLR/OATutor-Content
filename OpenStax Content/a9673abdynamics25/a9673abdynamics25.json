    "body": "A large rocket has a mass of 2.00\u00d710**6 kg at takeoff, and its engines produce a thrust of 3.50\u00d710**7 N. (a) Find its initial acceleration if it takes off vertically. (b) How long does it take to reach a velocity of $$120$$ $$\\frac{km}{h}$$ straight up, assuming constant mass and thrust? (c) In reality, the mass of a rocket decreases significantly as its fuel is consumed. Describe qualitatively how this affects the acceleration and time for this motion.",
